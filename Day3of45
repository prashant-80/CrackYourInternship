1) sort colors -> dutch flag algorithm
2) find the dublicate number  --> cyclic sort algorithm 
3)remove dublicate from sorted array  --> two pointer approach
4)set matrix zero
6)best time to buy and sell stocks --> two pointers
7)best time to buy and sell stocks 2
8)merge sorted array --> three pointers (i,j,k)
9)majority element --> hash maps or sort the array and return the middle element
10)find all dublicates in array --> store freq in map ans pushback ele which has freq greater than 1
11)count nice pairs -->transfrom array and use map to store count and update count before inserting in maps if element is already present in map
12)top view of binary tree
